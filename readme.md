This is a music mod that brings the De-Digivolutioning Digimon to de-life by randomizing classic anime-inspired, vocalless PS1 tracks from **Digimon World Digital Card Battle** for the De-Digivolution in Digimon Story Time Stranger.

**Key Features:**

  * **Classic Anime-inspired Soundtrack:** Replaces De-Digivolution tracks with iconic, instrumental themes from *Digimon World Digital Card Battle* —no vocals, pure nostalgia.
  * **Randomized Tracks:** Each De-Digivolution event can play one of several alternative tracks, keeping the experience fresh and unpredictable.
  * **Integrated SFX:** Each track includes sound effects from classic Digimon Story games and Digimon World 1, mainly Digimon Story DS, to ensure the digivolution sequence remains impactful even with new music.
  * **Smooth Reverb Ending:** Every track features a custom reverb ending for seamless transitions, making the music feel natural as you play.

## **Randomized De-Digivolution Tracks**

Tracks are organized by cue, each representing a De-Digivolution sequence. For each cue, the following tracks are randomized:

### **Standard De-Digivolution**

- **Brave Heart**  
  *Preview: [Digimon World Digital Card Battle Brave Heart (Vocalless PS1 Instrumental)](https://youtu.be/-VKWc83Iyh0?si=iFufgSrw3_WI8Abx)*

- **Break Up!**

### **Short De-Digivolution**

- **Brave Heart (Short)**  
- **Break Up! (Short)**  

### **Important Note:**
```
Every De-Digivolution sequence now features fully randomized music—each transformation will play a different track from the available pool, making every moment unique. If you skip the Standard De-Digivolution animation, the mod instantly switches to a randomly selected Short De-Digivolution track for a seamless experience.

For example: If "Brave Heart (Devolution)" is playing during Standard De-Digivolution and you skip the animation, the mod will immediately choose and play one of the three Short Conversion tracks at random, ensuring the music always fits the action.
